GameChallenge1
==============

I will post any information or sample code for Game Challenge 1 here.


**Goal:** Design and program a game using Processing.  You will follow the same process we used for the Raincatcher program.

**Part 1:** Write down a goal for your game.  If you don’t have a set goal in mind, your finished product will keep changing and you’ll never get there.  Example: “Create a two-player game of Pong.  Each time a player scores, their score increases, and when one player reaches 10 points, that player is declared the winner.”  Due the day the project is assigned.  5 points.

**Part 2:** Break the game down into manageable parts.  Describe each part in pseudocode to clarify what you are trying to do.  Due no later than the end of the second day of the project.  10 points.

**Part 3:** Code the actual game.  Start by coding the individual segments you already identified, then improve them, create classes and objects, and combine them.  Due no later than the end of the fourth day of the project.  20 points.

**Part 4 – Documentation:** When you turn in the code, it should be accompanied by parts 1 and 2 as well as a listing of any bugs you have found and improvements that might be made to it.  10 points.

**Timeline:**

1-2: Part 1 due 4/29.  Part 2 due 5/1.  Parts 3 and 4 due 5/3.

7-8: Part 1 due 4/29.  Part 2 due 4/30.  Parts 3 and 4 due 5/6.

9-10: Part 1 due 4/30.  Part 2 due 5/1.  Parts 3 and 4 due 5/6.

**Standards and requirements for overall evaluation of your project:**
The project should pose a reasonable level of challenge.  If you are struggling, I don’t want you to try something way over your head.  On the other hand, if you have prior experience, you shouldn’t be doing something very easy.  I expect a game over condition that will end the game.  I encourage you to add a restart button if appropriate, use images, and find ways to differentiate your game from those of your classmates.  Be prepared, if asked, to explain any section of your code and how you came up with it.  Do not copy directly from examples you find, although you may certainly look at examples of similar games. 

**Standards for grading of code:**
Code must be clear.  Comments should be included where appropriate.  Code must be object-oriented and easy to modify. 

**Remember: If you want a perfect score, go beyond the minimum requirements!**
